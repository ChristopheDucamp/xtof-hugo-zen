What I'm doing as of **Sunday, June 26, 2022**

Looking for the last phase of my career. I wanna become a good grandfather and a [professional skipper](https://ducamp.me/Sea_captain#Skipper)

- Studying ([RYA](https://ducamp.me/RYA))'s [Yachtmaster Offshore](https://ducamp.me/Yachtmaster) theory.
- Reading RYA - "Navigation Handbook" ([Melanie Barlett](https://ducamp.me/Melanie_Bartlett)
- Training with [Nicolas Joubert (sail-master-training)](https://sail-master-training.com) in Saint-Malo (France) and [Channel Islands](https://ducamp.me/Channel_Islands).

(Thanks to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) for the idea of [keeping a /now page](https://nownownow.com/about) like this one.)
