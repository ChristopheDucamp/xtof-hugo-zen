What I'm doing as of **Friday, July 1st 2022**

Looking for the last phase of my career. I wanna become a good grandfather and a [professional skipper](https://ducamp.me/Sea_captain#Skipper).

* Studying ([RYA](https://ducamp.me/RYA))'s [Yachtmaster Offshore](https://ducamp.me/Yachtmaster) theory.
** Reading RYA - "Navigation Handbook" - [Melanie Bartlett](https://ducamp.me/Melanie_Bartlett) 
** Building [flashcards](https://ducamp.me) around "Navigation Exercises" - (author = [Chris Slade](https://ducamp.me/Chris Slade))

## Planning 2022 Q3
* July : looking for sailing positions from mid-july (2nd mate)  
* August : follow up instruction with <a rel='muse friend met' href="https://sail-master-training.com">Nicolas Joubert (sail-master-training)</a> in Saint-Malo (France) and [Channel Islands](https://ducamp.me/Channel_Islands).
* September : Anjou w my family + looking up for positions North Europe (Baltic sea or Brittany)
