What I'm doing as of **Sunday, July 3rd 2022**

Looking for the last phase of my career. I wanna become a good grandfather and a [professional skipper](https://ducamp.me/Sea_captain#Skipper).

## Studying [RYA](https://ducamp.me/RYA)'s [Yachtmaster Offshore](https://ducamp.me/Yachtmaster) theory.
* Reading RYA - "Navigation Handbook" - [Melanie Bartlett](https://ducamp.me/Melanie_Bartlett)
* Building [flashcards](https://ducamp.me/Flashcards) around "Navigation Exercises" - (author = [Chris Slade](https://ducamp.me/Chris_Slade))
* [Exploring the map of Grand Paris](https://www.enlargeyourparis.fr/balades/le-randopolitain-sentiers-grande-randonnee-en-ile-de-france) with the Randopolitain.

## Planning 2022 Q3
* July : Learning in Paris. Indieweb optimizations.  Navigation around mid-July (Portugal -> Medditerranean)
* August : follow up instruction with <a rel='muse friend met' href="https://sail-master-training.com">Nicolas Joubert (sail-master-training)</a> in Saint-Malo (France) and [Channel Islands](https://ducamp.me/Channel_Islands).
* September : Anjou w my family + looking up for positions North Europe (Baltic sea or Brittany)
